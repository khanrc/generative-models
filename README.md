# Generative models

The project that implements generative models. References are various but mainly refer to https://github.com/wiseodd/generative-models.

based on python 2.7, tensorflow 0.12

## ToDo

- [ ] Datasets with diffent image shape
	- MNIST 까지 커버하는 건 좀 어려울 것 같은데...
	- 이건 따로 만드는 게 맞는 것 같음
